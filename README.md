This project acts as a benchmark for courses I give on [react](https://reactjs.org/) and all its ecosystem, such as:

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [ES6 features](http://es6-features.org)
- [Flow](https://flow.org/)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [react router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose)
- [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
- [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
- [redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [react-redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html)
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
- [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)

Each commit in the repo is a lesson about one or more arguments, driving organically the student from zero to a complete web application.
